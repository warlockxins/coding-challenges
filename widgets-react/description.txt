In this assignment, you should develop a small business-form visualisation library.
Your solution should accept the plain JSON file as input and build the DOM-structure
to ensure a visual result comparable with the sample graphical design.
The JSON file contains the logical markup of the business form.
Ideally, your solution should be capable of downloading the JSON from the given URL
and build the user interface on the fly.
You should not implement any business-logic, just build the UI.
You should write this solution with Angular 2+ or React.
