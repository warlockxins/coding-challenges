## Notes

1. I made this with Node version v10.15.3
2. Didn't bother styling myself, Bootstrap for everything
3. I decided not to create more Form field types than 2: just an `input` and misterious `currency` field
4. Didn't bother cleaning automatically generated junk from starter project, like service workers etc.
5. Had a lot of fun, I will actually need this for my next weeks job ;) but in Vue.js
